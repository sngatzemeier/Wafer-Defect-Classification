										<p>
											On wafer electrical signal output is the ultimate source of truth with best resolution for defects at bit level. Our ability to use the on wafer electrical signal at bit level collected at probe (end of processing line), to identify defect patterns on wafer, correlate them to the source of the defect generating step or equipment, isolate and fix the root cause, and eventually be able to correlate the equipment signals with such defects on wafers can be extremely powerful in reducing waste, improving yield, and overall cost. The value proposition of this project can be summarized to the following key points:
											<ul>
												<li>Improved wafer yield resulting in lower die cost</li>
												<li>Faster response to identify and mitigate / fix defect sources</li>
												<li>Efficient use of human resources by automating defect classification and wafer disposition</li>
												<li>Ability to predict probability of defect sources and addressing them ahead of defect occurrence</li>
											</ul>

							<h2>Scaling AI in Semiconductor Industry</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							McKinsey research indicates that AI/ML now contributes between $5 billion and $8 billion annually to earnings before interest and taxes at semiconductor companies <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/scaling-ai-in-the-sector-that-enables-it-lessons-for-semiconductor-device-makers" class="Link">(Continue Reading)</a>. However, only 30% of Semiconductor companies that responded to a survey indicated that they are generating value through AI/ML. By prioritizing improvements in end-to-end yield, semiconductor companies can better manage cost pressures and sustain higher profitability. The path forward involves a shift in mind-sets as well as deployment of advanced-analytics solutions. How can you shift to add value to your manufacturing process with AI?

						<h2>Increasing costs of semiconductor technology development</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Research and design costs for the development of a chip increased from about $28 million at the 65 nanometer (nm) node to about $540 million at the leading-edge 5 nm node (Image below). Meanwhile, fab construction costs for the same nodes increased from $400 million to $5.4 billion. In order to get return on investment factories have to develop technologies efficiently and transfer them to high volume manufacturing with high yield. Enabling yield ramp requires defect control and this is an important area where significant human involvement still happens in the semiconductor industry <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/scaling-ai-in-the-sector-that-enables-it-lessons-for-semiconductor-device-makers" class="Link">(McKinsey article)</a>.

						<h2>Applying AI to wafer visual inspection steps</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Visual inspection of wafers. This step, which helps ensure quality by detecting defects early in the front-end and back-end production process, is frequently conducted during production—for example, using cameras, microscopes, or scanning-electron microscopes. Those images are still commonly evaluated manually by operators for potential defects, however, leaving them subject to error and backlogs and driving up costs. Modern wafer-inspection systems, made possible by advances in deep learning for computer vision, can be trained to detect and classify defects on wafers automatically, with an accuracy on par with or better than human inspectors. Specialized hardware, such as tensor-processing units, and cloud offerings enable automated training of computer-vision algorithms. This, in turn, allows for faster piloting, real-time inference, and scalable deployment <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/scaling-ai-in-the-sector-that-enables-it-lessons-for-semiconductor-device-makers" class="Link">(McKinsey article)</a>.

						<h2>Taking the leap forward in semiconductor yield</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							A key differentiating factor in semiconductor technology competitiveness and higher profitability is improving end-to-end yield—encompassing both line yield (wafers that are not scrapped) and die yield (dice that pass wafer probe testing). A McKinsey study indicates that while process technologies have improved to manage yield, advanced data analytics and application of AI in this effort has not happened and could be significantly beneficial to industries. As noted by the CEO of advanced-analytics company Motivo Engineering, “Each fab has thousands of process steps, which, in turn, have thousands of parameters that can be used in different combinations. With so many factors in play, we see a lot of chip failures or defects.” Given its complexities, traditional quantitative analysis wouldn’t help fabs uncover all improvement opportunities, and we need advanced analytics and a new paradigm.<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/taking-the-next-leap-forward-in-semiconductor-yield-improvement" class="Link">(Continue Reading)</a>.
